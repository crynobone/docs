## What is Orchestra Platform? {#what}

* **ACL and User Management** are repetitive boilerplate module on every projects, lets stop reinventing the wheel and let Orchestra Platform do its magic. If you need something more advanced, there are more than 20 events that you can hook into your own implementation without overwriting Orchestra Platform core file.
* **Responsive Design** is always available when you're on mobile.
